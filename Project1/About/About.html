    <div id="About">
        <p class="name">This website was made to mimic that of a museum website. My goal is to showcase what wesbites I
            was into in my youth. Most of the websites shown have lost some popularity but are still iconic for their
            time. I wanted to show not only how the websites functioned but their quirks as well. Sometimes the websites
            were notorious for strange bugs or obvious faults, but they still all have a place in the history of my own
            internet experience.</p>
